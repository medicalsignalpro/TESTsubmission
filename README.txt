This submission doesnt do much.  

The only thing it does is put this README file into an edit box on a figure.

I have created it in order to test the 
submission process with something simple before I make other submissions.

If I learn anything about the submission process of interest I will 
edit this README.txt file accordingly.

First submission went pretty seamlessly. What I've learned so far:

1) Matlab asks for your Github repository.  From Github if you right click on 
   your repository name  (At the top of the page is user/submission with 
   submission underlined) Im my case I right clicked on TESTsubmission 
   and a menu option was  Copy Link.  I did  this and this
   https://github.com/medicalsignalpro/TESTsubmission 
   was coppied, which I pasted into the appropriate spot in the Matlab File Share 
   github option. 

2) THe rest of it went smoothly.  I found that when I downloaded the submission 
   from Matlab, github took care of putting them in a zip which appeared in my 
   download file.
